        <div class="introduction">
            <p>I was born in Curitiba, Brazil. Between 2017 and 2019, I lived in Buenos Aires, Argentina, serving with
                the church which I'm part of as a volunteer. During High School, I won medals from the National Math
                Olympics (OBMEP) and had the opportunity to take advanced math classes. I recently received a bachelor's
                degree in Computer Science from Universidade Federal do Paran√° (UFPR).
            </p>
            <p>I've been interested in maths and arts since I was little and I also have been curious and had a yearning
                for learning more from the beginning. I'm self-taugh in most of the technologies that I worked with. I
                have interest in Computer Graphics, in special physics-based animations, and seek to improve in this
                area. I intend to work with the development of tool for animation and VFX studios, as well as for the
                game industry.
